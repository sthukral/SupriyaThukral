    <p>When I'm not learning about data structures and algorithms, I'm out photographing couples madly in love,
        celebrating their wedding day with their closest friends and family.
        <br>I have been running <a href="https://www.chasingmoments.ca" target="_blank">Chasing Moments</a> since
        December, 2015, and have loved seeing this passion project
        grow into something meaningful.
