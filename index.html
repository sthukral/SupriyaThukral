                            <h1>Published Wedding Photographer</h1>
                            <p>In 2015, I turned my hobby into a hustle. Since photographing the first wedding in
                                2015, being published in 4 magazines, I closed out 2021 with a grand total of 36
                                galleries! </p>
                            <a href="#published" data-bs-toggle="collapse">Read More</a>
                            <div id="published" class="collapse">
                                <p>After experiencing being part of the community in Honduras and Nicaragua, I was upset
                                    that I had not been able to capture my experience in photos. I decided to purchase a
                                    higher-end camera and learn how to use it. I learned quickly, and soon after had the
                                    opportunity to photograph one of my first weddings.</p>

                                <p>In 2016, I was accepted into the Summer Company Program, a government initiative that
                                    teaches students how to create and manage their own enterprises. I learned plenty
                                    that summer, and from photographing maybe 5 weddings a year in 2016, in 2021, we
                                    closed the year with 36 galleries, with 2022 already booked up!</p>

                                <p>Since 2016, I have expanded my one-person team to a team of several photographers and
                                    videographers.</p>

                                <p>I never would have imagined how much I would learn from running a small business. I
                                    have worn many hats, including being the first point of contact for all inquiries,
                                    learning how to pitch my own talents, managing the backend of the business using a
                                    CRM, and even marketing myself to potential clients. And I'm still learning!</p>

                                <p>Since that first wedding (and nearly every one since then), I've learned the
                                    importance of communication, how to work with people, and how to turn business
                                    opportunities into successful ventures. On top of all this, I've gained many skills
                                    that will make me more attractive for future employers.</p>

                                <p>While volunteering with Students Offering Support (SOS), I delivered numerous Physics and Math review sessions to first-year students who were getting ready for their midterms. The funds generated from these sessions went toward establishing a school in Nicaragua. </p>

                                    <p>During the summer, I was able to participate in the community where this school was established and even helped to construct a portion of it!</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I also volunteered with a non-profit organization called Global Brigades (GB) to help the residents of an impoverished Honduran village improve their physical health. I polished up my Spanish and travelled to Honduras for a week of interpreting, collecting data, and assisting the medical crew at the community.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>These experiences taught me plenty about community. It was a life-changing experience that taught me about how privileged we are as students and people in general.</p>

                                <p>Throughout 2016 and 2017, I also started COPE McMaster's Knowledge Translation
                                    Committee.
                                    COPE is a
                                    student club at McMaster University focused on destigmatizing mental health, and
                                    influenced by my coursework in Neuroscience, I had recognized a gap in communication
                                    between the research world and the general population. And so I started tackling
                                    this
                                    gap in my own local community. While there is a lot of amzing research readily
                                    available
                                    to
                                    students and the community in general, unfortunately not everyone is able to
                                    understand
                                    scientific
                                    and
                                    statistical jargon.</p>
                                <p>And again, much like in the other initiatives I've been a part of, I had an amazing
                                    team
                                    who made
                                    this
                                    Knowledge Translation initiative a reality. I worked with a team of 15 students that
                                    I
                                    had vetted to be passionate about knowledge translation, and off we went to work.
                                    This
                                    was such a great opportunity for me to share something that I was passionate about,
                                    and
                                    even more excited to be able to put my skills acquired from my research courses to

                                <p>Throughout high school, I was enrolled in an Enhanced French Program, and in 2014, I
                                    participated in the Explore Ontario program to become fluent in French. I went to
                                    the
                                    University of Trois

                                <p>In 2015, I volunteered my time as a Bilingual Student Editor and Translator on the

                                    Sometimes,
                                    clubs are the only opportunity that students have to build real world skills, as

            <p>While running my photography business, and collaborating with other businesses, I had realized that I
                really wanted to equip other small businesses with the tools to succeed. When the pandemic started in
                2020, this was even more important for mom and pop shops where the businesses sometimes did not even
                have a website. I worked with a makeup artist to help her with her website, as well as teach her about
                all the FREE tools available to her for running a successful business.</p>
            <p>And eventually, the behind-the-scenes work of mantaining a website became my obsession. I studied the
                various methods a person could go about building their own website: WordPress versus Wix versus
                Squarespace, and then I landed on using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and so on.</p>
            <p>This key moment transported me back to my high school programming classes, and creating a sudoku game
                using simple Java.</p>
            <p>Realizing that this is the next direction, I quickly enrolled in the first year Computer Science course
                at McMaster University. I'm currently in the process of transferring to a Software Engineering program
                from Computer Science at McMaster University, and I already know that this was the right choice!</p>

            <p>In 2021, I became heavily involved in the world of hackathons! That said, I'm currently the Head of
                Sponsorship at DeltaHacks - McMaster own hackathon for change. The hackathon will be on the weekend of
                January 14th, 2022.</p>
            <p>Aside from helping with organizing the hackathon, I've taken part in several hackathons including Hack
                the North, and Hack Western.</p>
            <p>In Hack Western, I was able to create a tool for the health care industry.</p>
