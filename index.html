                            <h1>Published Wedding Photographer</h1>
                            <p>In 2015, I turned my hobby into a hustle. Since photographing the first wedding in 2015, being published in 4 magazines, I closed out 2021 with a grand total of 36 galleries! </p>
                            <a href="#published" data-bs-toggle="collapse"><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light">Read More</button></a>
                            <div id="published" class="collapse">
                                <p>After experiencing being part of the community in Honduras and Nicaragua, I was upset
                                    that I had not been able to capture my experience in photos. I decided to purchase a
                                    higher-end camera and learn how to use it. I learned quickly, and soon after had the
                                    opportunity to photograph one of my first weddings.</p>
                                <p>In 2018, I was accepted into the Summer Company Program, a government initiative that
                                    teaches students how to create and manage their own enterprises. I learned plenty
                                    that summer, and from photographing maybe 5 weddings a year in 2018, in 2021, we
                                    closed the year with 36 galleries, with 2022 already booked up!</p>
                                <p>Since 2015, I have expanded my one-person team to a team of several photographers and
                                    videographers.</p>
                                <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.chasingmoments.ca" role="button" target="_blank">Chasing Moments Photography »</a>

                                <p>I never would have imagined how much I would learn from running a small business. I
                                    have worn many hats, including being the first point of contact for all inquiries,
                                    learning how to pitch my own talents, managing the backend of the business using a
                                    CRM, and even marketing myself to potential clients. And I'm still learning!</p>
                                <p>Since that first wedding (and nearly every one since then), I've learned the
                                    importance of communication, how to work with people, and how to turn business
                                    opportunities into successful ventures. On top of all this, I've gained many skills
                                    that will make me more attractive for future employers.</p>

                                Offering Support and Global Brigades.</p>

                                <p>While volunteering with Students Offering Support (SOS), I delivered numerous Physics
                                    and Math review sessions to first-year students who were getting ready for their
                                    midterms. The funds generated from these sessions went toward establishing a school
                                    in Nicaragua. </p>
                                <p>During the summer, I was able to participate in the community where this school was
                                    established and even helped to construct a portion of it!</p>
                                <p>I also volunteered with a non-profit organization called Global Brigades (GB) to
                                    assist at a medical clinic in a small rural village in Honduras. I polished up my
                                    Spanish and travelled to Honduras for a week of interpreting, collecting data, and
                                    assisting the medical crew at the community.</p>
                                <p>These experiences taught me plenty about community. It was a life-changing experience
                                    that taught me about how privileged we are as students and people in general.</p>

                                dedicated to de-stigmatizing mental health. </p>

                                <p>Influenced by my coursework in Neuroscience, I'd noticed a gap in communication
                                    between the research community and the public at large. So I set out to fill this
                                    gap in my own neighbourhood. While there is plenty of excellent research available
                                    to students and the general public, not everyone is able to comprehend scientific
                                    and statistical jargon.</p>
                                <p>In 2016 when we launched the team, it was only because of the efforts of my team that
                                    we were able to make this Knowledge Translation Committee successful. I had
                                    recruited a team of 15 students and we had gotten a number of professors and other
                                    researchers to peer review our knowledge translation pieces. This was an excellent
                                    chance for me to get my voice out there and share something I was passionate about,
                                    and I was even more eager to use the skills I had acquired from my research classes.

                            <p>I've done my best to keep in touch with the French language, even though I live in
                                Ontario. I grew up learning French, and I'm looking forward to being able to continue
                                using this beautiful language for years to come.</p>

                                <p>I studied French in high school, as a part of an Enhanced French program, and during
                                    the summer of 2014, I took part in the Explore Ontario program to become fluent. I
                                    attended the University of Trois Rivieres, where I was immersed in the Quebecois
                                    culture and improved my French fluency. </p>
                                <p>I committed my time as a Bilingual Student Editor and Translator on the Foundation
                                    for Student Science and Technology's International Student Editorial Board in 2015,
                                    learning and further developing my fluency in French. I continued to nurture my
                                    enthusiasm and interest for evidence-based study while working as a peer reviewer on
                                    neuroscience, biology, and physics research papers submitted by students.</p>

                            <p>My interest in space exploration began when I was younger and looked up to Roberta
                                Bondar. In 2016, I served as the president of MOON Club, one of McMaster's first
                                astronomy clubs.</p>

                            <div id="moon" class="collapse">
                                <p>During this time, I shared my love for the stars and showed other students how to
                                    appreciate this part of our world. The team at MOON was key in building a tight-knit
                                    community creating a space for students passionate about all things astronomy. As a
                                    team, we hosted many star gazing nights, visits to the McMaster planetarium, among
                                    others.</p>
                                <p>Aside from just hosting these events, one of the takeaways I've had from
                                    university clubs is the learning experience. Meeting new people and befriending them
                                    over a shared interest is a great way to create relationships on campus. Student
                                    organizations are often the only channel through which students may develop genuine
                                    real-world skills and social.

                    <h2>Collaborating with Small Businesses</h2>
                    <p>Since the onset of the pandemic in the March of 2020, many small businesses have had to pivot. The new predominantly virtual environment allowed me to create a series called "Friendor Friday," in which I conducted a live Instagram interview of local businesses through the summer of 2020 and part of 2021. The main goal of this series has been to highlight small businesses and their products or services in an intimate setting that shows the human side of their business. This journey has changed my life through meeting new people, gaining skills such as public speaking, acting on camera and building a virtual distribution channel - it's been very rewarding. </p>
                    <p>In 2022, I will add to this series by helping small businesses with their websites, marketing strategy, and online presence.</p>

                    <h2>Transitioning to a New Industry</h2>
                    <p>From 2012 - 2017, I completed my first undergraduate degree in Biology and Psychology. However, after going through the process of applying to medical schools and even interviewing at two of them, I realized that I did not want to go down that path.</p>
                    <p>Countless exams and sheer memory work were not fueling my entrepreneurial flame or adding value to my life. So I took some time to explore my options, and along the way, learned a lot about the back end of running a business full-time. I quickly became acquainted with building a website from scratch, learning how to market my photography skills, working with people from all cultures and backgrounds, and basically getting out of my comfort zone every day.</p>
                    <p>However, throughout this journey, I felt most challenged and eager to learn how I could present myself in the online world. So, in the summer of 2020, during the onset of the pandemic, I officially enrolled in my first Computer Science course, and the rest is history.</p>

I have had the opportunity to learn plenty from my peers, and I've networked with some amazing tech-based companies.</p>

                    <p>While I observed several hackathons during the year, I finally submitted my first-ever hackathon project at HackWestern and gave my first-ever pitch. Although I was exhausted from the long weekend of hacking, all the learning was well worth it.</p>
