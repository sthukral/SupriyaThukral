            <p>Throughout high school, I was enrolled in an Enhanced French Program, and in 2014, I participated in the
                Explore Ontario program to become fluent in French. I went to the University of Trois Rivieres, and it
                was the best time I had learning about another culture.

            <p>In 2015, in pursuit of another experience I volunteered my time throughout the school with two
                organizations: Students Offering Support and Global Brigades. </p>
            <p>With Students Offering Support, I taught
                several Physics and Math review classes to first year students who were preparing for their upcoming
                midterms. The proceeds from these sessions went towards building a school in Nicaragua. During the
                summer, I
                had the chance to firsthand see where there funds went, and even got a chance to create some of the
                walls of
                the school!</p>
            <p>Global Brigades had a focus on the physical wellbeing of citizens of a small village in Honduras. I
                brushed up on my Spanish skills and flew to Honduras for a week of translating, collecting data, and
                assisting the medical crew at the village.</p>

            <p>I've always had an interest in space exploration, and in 2016, I led McMaster's first astronomy club, and
                we had an AMAZING team who really made our educational events happen. We hosted many star gazing nights,
                as well as visits to the McMaster planetarium. Aside from just hosting these events, one of the biggest
                takeaways I've had from university clubs is the social outlet that they provide for students. Sometimes,
                clubs are the only opportunity that students have to build real world skills, as well as social skills.

            <p>In 2015, I quit my part-time job at Starbucks for pursuing my own venture in photography... And I made
                it! I am published photographer in several wedding magazines. My last publication was in MunaLuchi
                Bride.</p>
            <p>From doing maybe 5 weddings a year in 2016, in 2021, we closed the year with 36 galleries! I have since
                expanded my one-person team to a team of several photographers and videographers. 2022 is a year is
                actually booked up! In 2015, I never would have imagined how much I would learn from starting a
                business.</p>
            <p>In 2016, I was accepted in the Starter Company Program, which is a program that has the goal of helping
                students develop their small business ideas into full-fledged businesses. Throughout the span of running
                the business, I have worn many hats, including being the first point of contact for all inquiries,
                managing all bookings using a CRM, building a website, managing the SEO of my site to rank well on
                Google, managing the finances and taxes of my business, leveraging social media and Facebook ads to meet
                couples needing professional photography, and most importantly, making sure each and every couple has a
                fantastic experience with our team! A wedding day is possibly a family's happiest day, and I'm so
                honoured that we get to celebrate with all our amazing couples!</p>

            <p>Throughout 2016 and 2017, I also started COPE McMaster's Knowledge Translation Committee. COPE is a
                McMaster club focused on destigmatizing mental health, and I had recognized the gap of evidence-based
                information for the McMaster community. While there is a lot of amzing research readily available to
                students and the community in general, unfortunately not everyone is able to understand scientific and
                statistical jargon.</p>
            <p>And again, much like in the other initiatives I've been a part of, I had an amazing team who made this
                Knowledge Translation initiative a reality.</p>

            <p>And last but not least, on December 7, 2021, I was featured on Narcity, doing what I do best: eating
                pizza at Earth to Table Bread Bar!</p>
        </article>

        <p>When I'm not learning about data structures and algorithms, I'm out photographing couples madly in love,
            celebrating their wedding day with their closest friends and family.
            <br>I have been running <a href="https://www.chasingmoments.ca" target="_blank">Chasing Moments</a> since
            December, 2015, and have loved seeing this passion project
            grow into something meaningful.

        <article>
            <p>My first undergrad degree at McMaster University was Honours in Biology and Psychology. My goal at the
                time was to enroll in medical school after my degree. However during the months preparing for the MCAT,
                and preparing for medical school interviews at McMaster University, and the University of Western
                Ontario, I had quickly realized that all the time that I would spend in medical school would take away
                from my creative, entrepreneurial time. </p>
            <p>While running my photography business, and collaborating with other businesses, I had realized that I
                really wanted to equip other small businesses with the tools to succeed. When the pandemic started in
                2020, this was even more important for mom and pop shops where the businesses sometimes did not even
                have a website. I worked with a makeup artist to help her with her website, as well as teah her about
                all the FREE tools available to her for running a successful business.</p>
            <p>And eventually, the behind-the-scenes work of mantaining a website became my obsession. I studied the
                various methods a person could go about building their own website: WordPress versus Wix versus
                Squarespace, and then I landed on using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and so on.</p>
            <p>This key moment transported me back to my high school programming classes, and creating a sudoku game
                using simple Java.</p>
            <p>Realizing that this is the next direction, I quickly enrolled in the first year Computer Science course
                at McMaster University. I'm currently in the process of transferring to a Software Engineering program
                from Computer Science at McMaster University, and I already know that this was the right choice!</p>

            <p>In 2021, I became heavily involved in the world of hackathons! That said, I'm currently the Head of
                Sponsorship at DeltaHacks - McMaster own hackathon for change. The hackathon will be on the weekend of
                January 14th, 2022.</p>
            <p>Aside from helping with organizing the hackathon, I've taken part in several hackathons including Hack
                the North, and Hack Western.</p>
            <p>In Hack Western, I was able to create a tool for the health care industry.</p>
